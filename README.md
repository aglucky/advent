# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions

This is my (late) set of solutions for this years advent of code.
I did it in Scala this year as an excuse to learn the language.

To run, ensure you have [Ammonite](https://ammonite.io) installed and run the ```amm``` command on the desired solution in the appropriate subfolder:

## Example

```console
cd day_one
curl https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/1/input -H 'Cookie: session=<your session id>' > input.txt
amm first_part.sc
```
